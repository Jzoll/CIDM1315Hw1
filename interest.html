        <h2>
            Spanish
        </h2>
        <p>
            Because of my diverse background, I've always wanted to learn Spanish. This desire only intensified when I
            consistently found myself in want of the skill while working and when I realized that it was a skill I
            wanted to be able to pass down to my future children. Deciding to be more proactive about it, last fall I
            started taking online classes with <i> Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México</i>. This spring I completed
            level 3.
            This fall I've decided to take a break from formal Spanish classes and work on my current skills. Learning a
            new language has been both fun and challenging.

        <h2>
            Yoga
        </h2>
        <p>
            I started taking classes on March 28th, 2022 and was immediately hooked. Since that initial class, I've
            attended <b>+40 yoga classes</b>. I'll admit that I had no idea how challenging yoga would be or that it
            would be
            such a fulfilling experience. By embracing yoga I have become stronger, more balanced, more mindful, and
            much better at managing my stress.

        <h2>
            Hiking
        </h2>
        <p>
            There's nothing quite like the outdoors. Feeling the fresh air, appreciating the scenery, being able to
            disconnect: nature is a wonderful thing. When the weather works out I love going hiking with my husband.
            Most of our hiking has been in Texas but, just this year, we made it out to see the California Redwoods. It
            was incredible to see the grandness of the trees.

        <h2>
            Reading
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sometime after getting my echocardiography registry I rediscovered my love of reading. Not just books but
            graphic novels as well. Currently, I'm reading <b>“How to Do the Work”</b> by Nicole LePera, <b>“El
                Principito”</b> by
            Antoine De Saint-Exupery, <b>“How to Tell a Story”</b> by The Moth, <b>“Dubliners”</b> by James Joyce,
            <b>“Godzilla: World of
                Monsters”</b>, and <b>“Chainsaw man”</b> by Tatsuki Fujimoto. I've been having a lot of fun by jumping
            between genres, it feels like a fun exercise for my brain. Unfortunately, by falling back into
            reading, I've also opened myself to accumulating a backlog of books to read, but the silver lining is that everything still
            manages to fit on my bookshelves.

        <h2>
            Mycology
        </h2>
        <p>
            Last year I purchased my husband a mushroom grow kit. From that kit, we grew lion's mane mushrooms. Feeling
            nostalgic and in want of an apartment-friendly hobby, I decided to further explore the world of fungi. I
            bought more mushroom kits and grew shiitake, oyster, and reishi mushrooms. Growing mushrooms has been a
            really interesting experience and I feel like I've learned a lot and still have much to learn. The most
            gratifying part about mycology is watching the mushrooms grow and figuring out fun ways to cook them! My
            goal for the end of the year is to figure out how to make my own grow kits.
