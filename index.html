            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>Hi, Howdy, Hello! My name is <b>Jessica Zoll</b>. I'm from San Antonio, Texas. I have been working as a
            sonographer
            since 2019, but I plan to transition into a career in software engineering. I'm very excited about this
            transition and am eager to learn all that I can so I may one day succeed in the field. My hobbies include
            mycology, gardening, comics, yoga, reading, and learning Spanish. I have a wonderful husband, and we will
            have been married for two years on August 31st of this year. My current philosophies are that it's important
            to mentally and physically set yourself up to achieve your goals and, above all else, be kind to yourself.

            What is Your Background?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am half Hispanic and half Asian. My mother is from Mexico and my father is from Taiwan. I have lived in
            San Antonio, Texas for most of my life. I graduated from high school with an Associate of Liberal Arts and
            an Associate of Natural and Physical Sciences. After high school, I obtained an Associate of Architecture
            and an Associate of Diagnostic Medical Sonography. With the latter, I was able to pursue a career in
            ultrasound. I am a registered diagnostic medical sonographer credentialed in <i>Obstetrics and Gynecology
            </i>and
            <i>Adult Echocardiography</i>.

            Major
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am majoring in Computer Information Systems. One day while working, I realized I needed yet another change
            in my life. I had just started working another job and received my credential in adult echocardiography. I
            loved scanning the body and having an intimate knowledge of anatomy and how it functions but, something was
            missing. I couldn't imagine doing the same job for the next 10 years. After talks with my husband, I
            discovered the field of software engineering and realized that's where my interests lie.
