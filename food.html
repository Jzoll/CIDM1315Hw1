            Favorite Food

        <p>
            Balanced food, that gives you contrasting flavors, that keeps you going back for more is my favorite.
            Additionally, I enjoy food with <i>fun textures</i>. I love trying and cooking new foods. Above all else, I
            love
            cooking with my husband and seeing what we come up with. Some of my favorite foods we've made have been
            instant pot chili, Korean-style udon noodles with honey miso chicken, and cacio e pepe with fresh shiitake.
            I know there are probably foods
        </p>

        <p>Having a multi-ethnic background, Iive been exposed to all sorts of foods from a young age. When I was in
            elementary I remember bringing in asian candies for my predominantly hispanic classmates to try. It seemed
            like everyone had a different reaction but what stood out to me was how important it is to try new things.
            By avoiding new things thereis so much that a person can miss out on not just with food but in life.

        <p> I've left off this list but these are some foods that simply make my mouth
            water in <b>no particular order</b>.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Japanese Sea Bream
            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                Uchi in Austin has constructed this fantastic piece of sushi. It's complemented with a yuzu sauce and
                melts in your mouth.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Egg Custard Buns
            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                Qi in Austin makes these wonderful dim sum and they are always fresh. They come piping hot and when you
                bite into the bun your mouth is met with a delicious egg filling that makes you think “Who knew an egg
                filling could be this tasty?”

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pan de Muerto
            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                Once a year I eat this bread. It's chewy and tastes like orange. It's nostalgic for me and something
                that goes wonderful with a warm beverage.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Concha
            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                I've had many conchas but never like the ones at La Panaderia here in San Antonio. The bread is
                wonderfully fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness. If you're lucky enough to eat one fresh
                you'll realize that it's what dreams are made of.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Braised and Charred Spanish Octopus
            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                Bliss in San Antonio makes this dish. It's flavorful, moist, tender, yet crispy on the outside.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Takoyaki
            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                In San Antonio, Hero's Ramen makes fabulous Takoyaki. It's covered in tasty toppings and filled with
                tender octopus meat.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Watermelon
            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                I've always enjoyed mine with a sprinkling of salt or plum powder.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Tamarind
            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                For me, this is a classic flavor that is bright, tangy, and sweet.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Mole and Hot Chocolate

            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                When visiting Oaxaca, Mexico I ate these every day, and every day they were simply delicious. My only
                regret is that I didn't bring more of the powders and sauces back home.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                My Mother-in-law's Tamales

            </li>
            <li class="multilevel">
                She makes all types every year during the colder months. My favorites are the mole-flavored ones.
